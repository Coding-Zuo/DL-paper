    "本次项目的目标是搭建一个基于检索式的简单的问答系统。至于什么是检索式的问答系统请参考课程直播内容/PPT介绍。 \n",
    "\n",
    "通过此项目，你将会有机会掌握以下几个知识点：\n",
    "1. 字符串操作   2. 文本预处理技术（词过滤，标准化）   3. 文本的表示（tf-idf, word2vec)  4. 文本相似度计算  5. 文本高效检索\n",
    "\n",
    "此项目需要的数据：\n",
    "1. dev-v2.0.json: 这个数据包含了问题和答案的pair， 但是以JSON格式存在，需要编写parser来提取出里面的问题和答案。 \n",
    "2. glove.6B: 这个文件需要从网上下载，下载地址为：https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/， 请使用d=100的词向量\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 检索式的问答系统\n",
    "问答系统所需要的数据已经提供，对于每一个问题都可以找得到相应的答案，所以可以理解为每一个样本数据是 <问题、答案>。 那系统的核心是当用户输入一个问题的时候，首先要找到跟这个问题最相近的已经存储在库里的问题，然后直接返回相应的答案即可。 举一个简单的例子：\n",
    "\n",
    "假设我们的库里面已有存在以下几个<问题,答案>：\n",
    "<\"贪心学院主要做什么方面的业务？”， “他们主要做人工智能方面的教育”>\n",
    "<“国内有哪些做人工智能教育的公司？”， “贪心学院”>\n",
    "<\"人工智能和机器学习的关系什么？\", \"其实机器学习是人工智能的一个范畴，很多人工智能的应用要基于机器学习的技术\">\n",
    "<\"人工智能最核心的语言是什么？\"， ”Python“>\n",
    ".....\n",
    "\n",
    "假设一个用户往系统中输入了问题 “贪心学院是做什么的？”， 那这时候系统先去匹配最相近的“已经存在库里的”问题。 那在这里很显然是 “贪心学院是做什么的”和“贪心学院主要做什么方面的业务？”是最相近的。 所以当我们定位到这个问题之后，直接返回它的答案 “他们主要做人工智能方面的教育”就可以了。 所以这里的核心问题可以归结为计算两个问句（query）之间的相似度。\n",
    "\n",
    "在本次项目中，你会频繁地使用到sklearn这个机器学习库。具体安装请见：http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html  sklearn包含了各类机器学习算法和数据处理工具，包括本项目需要使用的词袋模型，均可以在sklearn工具包中找得到。 另外，本项目还需要用到分词工具jieba, 具体使用方法请见 https://github.com/fxsjy/jieba"
